## Summary 

The SoilDivTemp project is aiming to quantify and understand vegetation diversity buffering of soil temperature fluctuations. This project is based on our collaboration with the international <a href="https://twitter.com/SoilTemp_proj">SoilTemp</a> consortium, which is compiling near surface temperature measurements around the world, across biomes and ecosystems.

## Abstract

The frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events, such as heatwaves and droughts, are increasing with global warming, threatening humanity and other life on Earth. For example, belowground communities and functions are highly sensitive to changes in microclimatic conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity, Gottschall et al., 2019; Cesarz et al., 2020). Yet, vegetation has shown its potential to mitigate external macroclimatic fluctuations by means of buffering processes, assuring smooth transitions between macro- and microclimatic conditions (de Frenne et al., 2019, 2021). Moreover, higher vegetation diversity has been shown to increase primary productivity and the length of the vegetation period (Huang et al., 2017, 2018; Sapijanskas et al., 2014). Therefore, vegetation diversity is expected to increase the macroclimate buffering effect and thus protect belowground communities and functions from dramatic external climatic changes (Gottschall et al., 2019). Here, we propose to quantify the effect of vegetation cover on climatic buffering across ecosystems and seasons using the SoilTemp database and remote-sensing measurements (e.g., NDVI, spectral diversity) as proxies of vegetation diversity. In addition, we propose to quantify the effect of vegetation diversity on climatic buffering across ecosystems across the globe using the SoilTemp database and associated vegetation surveys. In particular, we here aim to understand the mechanisms behind climate buffering of vegetation diversity by investigating the roles of primary productivity and vegetations' spatial and temporal complementarity.

## Hypothesis

Our main hypothesis is that vegetation diversity can buffer temperature fluctuations and extreme climatic event, and therefore, reduce the effects of climate change on ecosystems. We are testing this hypothesis using field measurements from the SoilTemp consortium and by linking our results to current research in BEF experiments; such as <a href="https://bef-china.com/">BEF China</a> and <a href="http://the-jena-experiment.de/">The Jena Experiment</a>.
