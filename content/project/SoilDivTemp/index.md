The SoilDivTemp project aims to quantify and understand diversity buffering of soil temperature fluctuation. This project is base on the international [SoilTemp](https://twitter.com/SoilTemp_proj) consortium compiling soil temperature measurements from around the world, biomes and ecosystems.

## Abstract

The frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events, such as heatwaves and droughts, are increasing with global warming, threatening humanity and other life on Earth. For example, belowground communities and functions are highly sensitive to changes in microclimatic conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity, Gottschall et al., 2019; Cesarz et al., 2020). Yet, vegetation has shown its potential to mitigate external macroclimatic fluctuations by means of buffering processes, assuring smooth transitions between macro- and microclimatic conditions (de Frenne et al., 2019, 2021). Moreover, higher vegetation diversity has been shown to increase primary productivity and the length of the vegetation period (Huang et al., 2017, 2018; Sapijanskas et al., 2014). Therefore, vegetation diversity is expected to increase the macroclimate buffering effect and thus protect belowground communities and functions from dramatic external climatic changes (Gottschall et al., 2019). Here, we propose to quantify the effect of vegetation cover on climatic buffering across ecosystems and seasons using the SoilTemp database and remote-sensing measurements (e.g., NDVI, spectral diversity) as proxies of vegetation diversity. In addition, we propose to quantify the effect of vegetation diversity on climatic buffering across ecosystems across the globe using the SoilTemp database and associated vegetation surveys. In particular, we here aim to understand the mechanisms behind climate buffering of vegetation diversity by investigating the roles of primary productivity and vegetations' spatial and temporal complementarity.

## Hypothesis

Our main hypothesis is that plant diversity can buffer temperature fluctuations (Fig. 1) and extreme climatic event (Fig. 2), and therefore, reduce the effects of climate change on ecosystems. We are testing this hypothesis using both experiments where diversity is manipulated; such as [BEF China](https://bef-china.com/) and [The Jena Experiment](http://the-jena-experiment.de/); and natural field measurements with the SoilTemp consorsium datasets.
