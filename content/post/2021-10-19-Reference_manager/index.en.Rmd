You can find numerous ways to manage you literature research and database. With the increasing number of paper published in every field, the manual archiving become impossible. Reference managers become a critical tool, to manage your reference database, dive in the database, extract the relevant references for publication and formatting your citations. Thus, numerous reference managers have pup out in the past decades. I was struggling in the past few weeks with my previous choice and how to choose a good one. Here are some keys to find the reference manager which fit to you.\
**Spoiler alert**: there is no good solution, only options that will fit more or less to your way of working.

# What are the current options?

More and more references managers become available in the past few years, here, are some of the most used in ecology and evolution:

-   Citavi ([webpage](https://www.citavi.com/en))

-   EndNote ([webpage](https://endnote.com/))

-   JabRef ([webpage](https://www.jabref.org/)): BibTex-based database built under Java but no MSWord Plugging

-   Mendeley ([webpage](https://www.mendeley.com/))

-   Paperpile ([webpage](https://paperpile.com/))

-   Sciwheel ([webpage](https://sciwheel.com/?lg))

-   Zotero ([webpage](https://www.zotero.org/))

# What are people using these days?

After a small pool on tweeter and in my lab:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">

‚ùì‚ùì‚ùìQUESTION‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì<br><br>Which reference manager are you using? Tell me why in the comment if you have a real good reason for it! <br><br>(I am sure this has been asked a thousand time ü§î)
