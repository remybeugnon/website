My research lies at the intersection of biodiversity, microclimate, and ecosystem functioning, with a particular focus on how plant diversity modulates microclimate and, in turn, shapes forest carbon dynamics. This dual focus has positioned me in a rapidly emerging research field that seeks to integrate microclimatic processes into our understanding of BEF relationships and carbon cycling under global change.
</p>
<p>
I began my academic trajectory in agricultural engineering before transitioning into ecology and evolution during my final year, with a master’s thesis on species interaction modelling (ISEM, Montpellier). This foundation led to my Ph.D. at iDiv (Germany), where I investigated tree-tree interactions and the influence of tree species richness on forest carbon cycling. My doctoral research highlighted how biodiversity positively affects litterfall, decomposition, soil carbon storage, and microbial functioning.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing microclimate as a key but underexplored driver of these processes, I pivoted my postdoctoral research toward microclimate science. I conducted a global analysis of how plant diversity shapes understory microclimates using data from BEF experiments, in collaboration with the Leipzig Institute of Meteorology (LIM, in prep., but see Schnabel, Beugnon et al., 2025). This work directly informs the hypothesis that biodiversity affects forest carbon not only through biotic interactions but also via its role in modulating microclimatic conditions.
</p>
<p>
To advance this emerging field, I have taken on an active leadership role in the microclimate research community. I serve on the scientific and practical committees of the Microclimate in Ecology and Biogeography (MEB) global network of microclimate researchers, contribute to methodological development (e.g., De Frenne et al. 2024; Gross MSc thesis; the Microclimate Database: https://meb-network.com/access-to-the-database/), and have helped develop new theoretical frameworks linking microclimate, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning (Beugnon et al. 2021, 2024; Kemppinen et al. 2024). These activities have laid the conceptual and collaborative foundations for the integrative and interdisciplinary approach in my projects.

1. Publications (2019-2025): I have authored 28 peer-reviewed articles, including in Nature Communications, Science Advances, Ecological Monographs, Ecology Letters, and Global Change Biology.

2. Supervision (2019-2025): I have co-supervised 2 PhD students and mentored 4 MSc, 2 BSc, 1 ENS Lyon gap-year, and 2 IUT Perpignan final-year students.

3. Teaching: I lectured in Ecology, Biodiversity, and Statistics at the bachelor’s and master’s levels (2021–2025), including module coordination.

4. Scientific Expertise: I contributed to a European Commission technical review on the Soil Monitoring Law (led by Dr. Carlos Guerra).

5. Community Engagement: As a member of the MEB steering committee, I support network organization, scientific animation, and community development through biannual committee meetings and active collaboration.

6. Outreach: I was interviewed by EOS (AGU) as a BEF expert (Sidik, 2023), and co-edited the Frontiers for Young Minds eBook Soil Biodiversity, featuring 33 articles by 50 scientists and translated into 22+ languages (Beugnon et al., 2022; 2024).

7. Peer Review: I serve as a reviewer for top-tier journals, including Ecology Letters, Functional Ecology, Global Change Biology, and Nature Communications.
