I am a master student in Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg. Since 2018, I am working as student helper for several [TreeDì]({{< relref "/project/TreeDi" >}}) projects in the BEF China platform. In 2020, I had the opportunity to write my bachelor thesis in one of these projects ([BSc. thesis](Bsc-thesis-GeorgHaehn.pdf)). During my thesis, I focused on litter functional dissimilarity effects on litter decomposition in a project led by [Rémy Beugnon]({{< relref "/authors/admin" >}}). This project was my first introduction to statistical analyses for ecosystem functioning questions. To improve my analysis skills I decided to focus my master studies on statistics in link with ecology and ecosystem functioning. 
In the moment, I am working as a student helper to maintain the [sPlot database](https://www.idiv.de/en/splot.html).
