I am a student in the bachelor program “Natural Resources Management” at Martin-Luther- University Halle-Wittenberg. This program, supported by the Institute of Geography and Geosciences and the Institute of Agriculture, connects the environmental compartments water, soil, and plants, and focuses on the sustainable use and protection of these natural resources.

In 2022, I did an ERASMUS semester at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences in Sogndal (Norway) and attended the program "From Mountain to Fjord - Geology and Ecology of Western Norway".

I am interested in ecosystem functioning and the importance of biodiversity for it. Especially, I am interested in forest ecosystems and their change and importance in times of climate change. For my bachelor thesis, which I am currently working on under the supervision of Rémy Beugnon, I am focusing on the effect of tree species richness on the spatial and temporal stability of forest microclimate. The microclimate data was collected within the MyDiv experiment, an experimental platform within the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv).
