I am second-year student in a Bachelor of Technology in Data Sciences program, I am particularly interested in data (database building and analyses).

The [MDB](https://meb-network.com/) database is a project aimed at centralizing all global data on soil and near-surface temperatures and make them more accessible on a unique database. As the database is under construction, my project is to create an interface allowing users to have access to this data through a map that allows users to visualize and easily request the data.
