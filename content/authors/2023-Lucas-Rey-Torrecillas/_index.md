I am second-year student in a Bachelor of Technology in Data Sciences program, I am particularly interested in data (database building and analyses).

The [MDB](https://meb-network.com/) database is a project aimed at centralizing all global data on soil and near-surface temperatures and make them more accessible on a unique database. As the database is under construction, my project is to create an interface allowing users to submit their data the database while providing them with feedback on potential input errors. The goal is to automate this process to assist the user to the fullest extent.
