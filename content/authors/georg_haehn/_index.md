I joined several Biodiversity Interaction projects as student helper in China and had the oppurtunity to write my bachelor thesis in one of these projects.
I focused on litter functional dissimilarity effects on litter decomposition in subtropical forest supervised by Rémy Beugnon ([BSc. thesis](thesis.pdf)). This was my first introduction to statistical analysis under questions of ecosystem functioning, to improve my analysis skills I decided to focus in my master on statistics as well as ecology and ecosystem functioning. In the moment I am working as a student helper to maintain the sPlot database.
