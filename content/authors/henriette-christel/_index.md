I am interested in understanding biodiversity ecosystem functioning, especially how species interact with each another and their place in the ecosystem.
I am doing my master thesis in the subtropical tree Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning experiment (BEF China). During my thesis I am focusing on tree species interaction effects on soil microbial properties such as microbial biomass and microbial respiration. I am investigating small-scale drivers such as soil moisture, depth or root biomass. This work is part of the Rémy Beugnon's PhD in the international research training group [TreeDì]({{< relref "/project/TreeDi" >}}.
